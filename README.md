# Police-Siren-Light-using-IC-555-Timer
This project presents a simple and cost-effective implementation of a police siren light system using the IC 555 timer. The system utilizes two IC 555 timer circuits configured in astable mode to generate alternating timing signals that control two sets of LEDs (red and blue). These timers are adjusted to blink the LEDs at regular intervals.
